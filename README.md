# PersonalHub
A place for me to communicate with fellow GitHub users = )

----

A place for me to share and talk about my plans and ideas for projects, = D

as well as to find and communicate with people who are interested in helping us make them a reality. ^^

----

i also hope ill be able to help make some awareness to a few things in my perspective,

one of them being the concept i named ''Mechanical UX'', 

which is a completely different UX approach
that goes against the ideas of the currently more trending UX approach that i nickname ''Fluid UX'', 

the ''Fluid UX'' that steve jobs brought, and apple and the whole smartphones world is all around.
